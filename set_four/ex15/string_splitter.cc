// This homework assignment is less about the mechanics of C++
// (inheritance, pointers, references) and more about problem
// solving.  This one in particular is meant to ease you into
// one of the more demanding tasks you'll encounter at boot camp.
// In the past few boot camps, lab 4 (2nd evening lab) has
// been pretty tough for people.  So this homework is meant to
// prime you for one of the challenges that the lab presents.
//
// The assignment in this lab is to write a function that takes
// a string of "1"s and "0"s and describes it as a set of 1s
// blocks and 0s blocks.  For the input string
// 000001111110000111111110000
// your function should return a std::vector of ints where each
// entry in this vector represents a transition point from
// one character into the other
// in this case,
// 012345678901234567890123456 <-- ruler
// 000001111110000111111110000
// the correct output would be a vector containing
// 5,11,15,23
// where these are ("0" indexed) positions where the character
// changes from its initial value to a different value.
// Your function should have the following signature:
//
// std::vector< int >
// split_zero_and_ones_string( std::string const & input_string );
//
// The way your assignment will be graded is by replacing your int main()
// with a new one which will call split_zero_and_ones_string().
//
// Think hard about how you test your function.  What are the "edge cases"
// where your function might fail? You can be pretty sure that I'll find
// those edge cases, so look closely for them.  (You may assume that the
// input string contains only 0s and 1s).

#include <vector>
#include <string>

std::vector<int> split_zero_and_ones_string( std::string const & input_string ){
  std::vector<int> result;
  int count = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < input_string.size(); i++){
    if (input_string[i] != input_string[i+1]){
      result.push_back(i);
    }
    if (result.size() == 0 && i == input_string.size()-1){
      result.push_back(input_string.size()-1);
    }
  }
  return result;
}
