class MonteCarlo {
public:

	// Constructor
	// Usage: MonteCarlo mc( xy, temp );
	// TO DO: Implement this function in MonteCarlo.cc
	MonteCarlo( Coordinates & xy, float temperature );

	// TO DO: Implement this function in MonteCarlo.cc
	~MonteCarlo();

	// The bolztmann function below is the workhorse for MonteCarlo Class
	// This function compares the z values of the new Coordinates "new_xy" and the stored Coordinates "last_accepted_xy_".
	//
	// Behavior:
	// If the "new_xy" has a lower z (score), the function will always accept the new_xy
	// If the "new_xy" has a higher z (score), the function will still sometimes accept the "new_xy" with a
	// probability given by the Metropolis criterion:
	// p = exp( -(deltaZ/temperature) )
	// where deltaZ is defined to be positive if new_xy has a larger z value than last_accepted_xy_.
	// The higher the temperature, the easier to accept higher z values.
	// (You may wonder where the "k" in "kT" went. Consider k to be rolled into the temperature.)
	// After computing p, you will sample from the uniform distribution between 0 and 1; if your
	// random number is less than p, accept the new coordinate.
	//
	// If the "new_xy" coordinate is accepted, the stored "last_accepted_xy_" must be set to this new value, and return true.
	// If the new coordinate "new_xy" is rejected, the passed-in "new_xy" coordinate will be overwritten with the stored
	// "last_accepted_xy_" value, and false will be returned. I.e. the proposed perturbation will be rejected.
	// TO DO: implement this function in MonteCarlo.cc
	bool boltzmann(Coordinates & new_xy);

	// The last Coordinates value that was accepted
	// TO DO: implement this function in MonteCarlo.cc
	Coordinates const & get_last_accepted_coordinates() const;

	// The last z (score) value that was accepted
	// TO DO: implement this function in MonteCarlo.cc
	double last_accepted_z();

	Uniform uniformRG_; // You shouldn't need to do anything in MonteCarlo.cc to initialize this - just use it!

	// TODO for you: declare the additional class member variables you use here
